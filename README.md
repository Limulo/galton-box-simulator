# Galton Box Simulator

This is a sketch made with [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the [PBox2D](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing) physics library.

It is a simulation of the [**Beam Machine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine) by sir. Francis Galton (a.k.a. _Galton box_).

You can see the sketch in action in this video:

The sketch has been designed with a procedural architecture in mind; what does it mean is that you can modify the geometrical structure of the _Bean Machine_ with easilly simply by changing some global variables, and the code will adjust itself automatically.

## Install

In order to use the code you need:
* to have your _Processing_ IDE up and running (look [here](https://vimeo.com/140600280) on how to set-up the Processing environment);
* install the _PBox2D_ library (for more information on how to install a library for your Processing environment, please visit [this](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library) link;
* Download the code from this repository, open it with your Processing IDE and run it!
